# Tryptamine Tolerance

Sobriety Tracker has a built-in Tryptamine (LSD, Mushroom, etc...)
tolerance calculator. To enable it, simply check the "Tryptamine" box
in the addiction editor. Your tolerance will then automatically be displayed.

To make use of this, simply multiply the tolerance percent by the new desired dose, to get the actual dose required to feel the desired effects.
